    <p class="centered">After graduating high school I entered the basic workforce learning to work cooperatively with others and get along with coworkers. While in highschool one of my favorite classes was proggramming so when I decided to advance my knowledge with a career I found Thinkful. Now currently a student at Thinkful I believe I have found something I could be happy practicing for the rest of my life.
